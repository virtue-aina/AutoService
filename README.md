# Authentication Service

## Overview
This project is an authentication service built using Java and Spring Boot. It includes dependencies for various Spring Boot starters, such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Web. Redis is used for session management or caching.

## Current State

### Authentication Service (Java)
The core backend service responsible for user authentication, implemented in Java using Spring Boot.

**Key responsibilities:**
- User registration
- User login
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token generation and validation
- Interaction with the database, JWT service, and cache

### Database
The database stores user information securely. A relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL is used, with Hibernate for ORM.

### JWT Service
Generates and validates JSON Web Tokens using libraries like jjwt.

### Redis Cache
Redis is used as an in-memory data structure store to improve performance.

## Upcoming Implementations

### TypeScript Client
Implement a client-side application using TypeScript to handle user interactions, form submissions, and API calls to the backend.

### User Registration
Implement user registration functionality, including form handling on the client side and endpoint creation on the backend.

### Password Hashing and Verification
Enhance security by implementing password hashing and verification using BCrypt.

### Redis Integration
Integrate Redis for caching session information and token blacklists.

### API Gateway Implementation
Set up an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway or Express Gateway to route client requests to the appropriate services.

### Enhanced Security
Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting and IP whitelisting, to protect the authentication service.
